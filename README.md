# typescript-generics
In this exercise I learned how to use Generics in TypeScript.

I did this exercise as part of my studies with 'Understanding Typescript' by Maximillian Schwarzmuller:
https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/

In this exercise, I learned and practiced: 
- What are Generics 
- Built-in Generics in TS
- Creating a Generic Function
- Working with Constraints
- The 'keyof' Constraint
- Generic Classes
- Generic Utility Types
- Generic Types vs Union Types

To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.
- In terminal type 'tsc --watch' to continuously compile all changes you make in the TS files to the JS files.
